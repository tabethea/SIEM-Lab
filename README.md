# SIEM Lab

## Description
This repository contains a step by step walkthrough of how I created a home SIEM lab in the cloud using Microsoft Azure. In this lab, I utilized Microsoft Azure to set up a virtual machine and purposefully disabled the firewall, transforming the virtual machine into a honeypot designed to attract and analyze potential attackers. I also configured log forwarding to direct the failed attack attempts to a central repository and connected this repository to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for further analysis and monitoring. Lastly, i created an attack map that allowed me to see where the attacks are coming from. Running this lab has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure, honeypot setup, log management, and SIEM integration.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

# Walkthrough:
## Created Free Azure Account
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account)

## Created a resource group inside Microsoft Azure

## Created a virtual network within the resource group

## Created the Honey Pot/Virtual Machine

## Created a rule that allows all traffic inbound into the virtual machine
Configured this through the network security group. As a result, anyone from the internet can now access our honeypot/virtual machine.

## Disabled WIndows Firewall within the Virtual Machine

## Pinged Virtual Machine from local computer
This ensures that our honeypot can be reached over the internet.

## Created a Log Analytics workspace
This will act as my log repository.

## Created a Sentinel and connected it to the Log Analytics workspace.
This allows me to access the logs in my log repository from my SIEM.

## Configured the "Windows Security Events via AMA" within Sentinel.
This  allows me to receive and observe the logs from the VIrtual Machine in Sentinel.

## Create Data Collection Rule
This rule is used by the virtual machine to foward logs to our Log Analytics workspace which allows me to acess them from my SIEM

Azure Monitor Windows Agent can be seen inside the Virtual Machine

## Viewed the Logs in the Log Analytics Workspace
Azure Monitor Windows Agent fowards logs to Log Analytics Workspace

## Queried the Log Analytics workspace With KQL to show failed attacks against our Honey Pot

## Imported a [Spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13EfjM_4BohrmaxqXZLB5VUBIz2sv9Siz/view?usp=sharing) from Josh Madakor into Sentinel Watchlist
This spreadsheet contains geographic information for each block of IP addresses which we can view in Log Analytics.

## Logs now have geographic information

## Created an Attack Map in Sentinel
This was done by pasting a [query](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErlVEK5cQjpGyOcu4T02xYy7F31dWuir/view?usp=drive_link) from Josh Madakor into a Sentinel workbook
